# Continuous Integration Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for a Java application using GitHub Actions. The CI pipeline will automatically build and test the Java application on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Add the project files to the repository via the GitHub web interface.
3. Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow file is correctly set up to trigger on push and pull requests.

## Expected Results

On every push or pull request to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically build and test the Java application, providing feedback directly on GitHub.
